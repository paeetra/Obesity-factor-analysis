# Obesity-factor-analysis
Python code for my bachelor's thesis titled 'Obesity Factor Analysis Using Statistical Methods,' developed using Jupyter Notebook.

Data about obesity factors was collected in a 2019. survey, and it was retrieved from Eurostat website in May 2024. Dataset was cleaned using Padas library in Python. 
Libraries used for the analysis are NumPy, statistsics and SciPy. Visalisations are made using Seaborn.
